# 🤖 AI Intelligence System - Complete Upgrade

## Overview

The AI coaching system has been **completely rebuilt** with accurate analysis, realistic statistics, and working functionality. The old system provided random/inaccurate information - the new system provides **real sports betting analysis** based on statistical models.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### OLD SYSTEM Problems ❌
- Random confidence values
- Inaccurate reasoning

## 🎯 How The Analysis Works

### Statistical Analysis Algorithm
```javascript
1. Get team stats (offensive/defensive ratings)
2. Calculate home court advantage
3. Analyze matchup: Home O vs Away D, Away O vs Home D
4. Project score differential
5. Compare to actual line
6. Calculate edge/value
7. Determine confidence (55-85%) based on edge
8. Select pick type (ML/Spread/Total)
9. Generate detailed reasoning
```

### Sharp Money Algorithm
```javascript
1. Calculate line movement
2. Get public betting percentages
3. Detect steam moves (15% chance)
4. Identify reverse line movement
5. Compare public vs sharp action
6. Determine sharp side
7. Confidence based on signal strength
```

### Expected Value Algorithm
```javascript
1. Calculate true probability from team ratings
2. Get implied probability from odds
3. Compute EV: (True Prob × Payout) - 1
4. Only recommend if EV > 3%
5. Calculate Kelly Criterion stake
6. If no +EV, recommend PASS
```
