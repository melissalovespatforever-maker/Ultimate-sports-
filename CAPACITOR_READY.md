## ✨ WHAT CAPACITOR DOES

**Before Capacitor:**
```
Your Web App (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
├─ Runs on browsers only
├─ Rosebud web: ✅ Live
├─ iOS App Store: ❌ Can't distribute
└─ Android Google Play: ❌ Can't distribute
```

**After Capacitor:**
```
Your Web App (Same code!)
├─ Runs on browsers: ✅ Rosebud
├─ Runs on iOS: ✅ App Store
├─ Runs on Android: ✅ Google Play
└─ Plus: Native capabilities (camera, notifications, etc.)
```
